# Badges :partying_face:

We strongly believe good work should be rewarded! 

If you are someone who goes over and above what is expected, your README would be updated with a number of customised badges. 

### Well what do these customised badges come to use for? 

-  Your README is going to look pretty :grin:!

-  While evaluating your overall performance throughout the course of the project, these customised badges will act as a guiding light for us. Whether it be crafting the perfect LOR or recommending you for the perfect internship, customised badges will help us identify folks who go over and above what's just told.


*"Ok, you've convinced me, but how do I get them?"*

These are the badges that you could win :

<img src="https://badgen.net/badge/community/guru/red?icon=discord" > Constantly engage with the community. This could be as simple as adding links to useful articles/ helping the community learn something interesting that you learnt over the week by conducting sessions. Egnite is a community driven platform and if you are someone who comes across as a community champ, well we can't help but reward you! </img>

<img src="https://badgen.net/badge/blog/master/purple?icon=wiki" > Well as we said, we are a community driven platform. However, we don't want to limit you within the community boundaries. You were made to fly! So if you have learn't something new and interesting during the project course, while going through additional materials, we strongly encourage you to post blog articles about it. While some of you might get a chance to be featured on our social media handles, everyone who made an effort to write a blog gets this badge. And this badge gets added for each blog you published! </img>
